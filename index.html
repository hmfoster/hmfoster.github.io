      <h1><a href="/Tinkering-Daydreaming/">On Tinkering, Day Dreaming, and Persevering</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Over the last week or so, I&#39;ve been moving at a fairly rapid pace through Hack Reactor&#39;s precourse material. What I&#39;m finding though, is that I&#39;m spending a far greater amount of time learning related technologies and terminology (seem my last post) than I am actually solving the problems and reading through the material. I found this quite frustrating at first, but I&#39;ve come to realize that this indirect learning is becoming more an more valuable. For one thing, its allowing me to accelerate my learning via transfer and adaptation. </p>

      <h1><a href="/Automated-Testing-Underscore/">Automated Testing and Underscore.js</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Late last week I finally got into some completely novel concepts for me in the precourse work. The remaining Git ideas were fairly basic (forks and pull requests, and the workflow HR expects us to follow). Not much interesting there. However, I then moved on to the section on Automated Testing, about which I had only had a vague understanding of the general idea before.</p>

      <h1><a href="/Review-Work/">Reviewing</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Since getting the HR precourse work on Monday, I’m happy to say I’ve been able to work through the first section fairly quickly. It involved a basic review of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I had actually already read all of the provided resources. Because I want to make sure I REALLY know this stuff, I still worked back through it all, recording particularly important/tricky points with Evernote to review yet again before my start date in late June. I believe I now have a strong understanding of all of the concepts I reviewed, but of course I will need to do a lot more practice–especially with CSS positioning!–before I really feel competent.</p>

      <h1><a href="/HR-Precourse-1/">HR Precourse Work Day 1</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>After weeks of anticipation, Hack Reactor has finally released the precourse work to my classmates and me. Before seeing the outline of the work, I was concerned that there would be many topics with which I have no familiarity. It looks like I’ve done a decent job prepping myself, however, as I have at least touched upon almost everything on the list.</p>

      <h1><a href="/Moving-On/">Moving On</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Ac ouple of years ago, I decided to try writing a <a href="http://samjshah.com/2014/07/25/musings-on-the-180-blog/">180blog</a>. It didn’t workout so well. I started out strong two years in a row, and two weeks in just ran out of steam. You know the deal, conflicting priorities blah blah blah. Anyway, I’m now moving away from teaching anyway. Long story short, I love teaching, but it’s become impractical for me to continue. Not the usual teacher burnout; seven years in I’ve got my routines and plans down and have an excellent work-life balance. However, when I was fourteen I found out that I have a degenerative retinal disease called retinitis pigmentosa. Big words that basically mean I’m losing my vision from the outside in. Yes, I could technically continue teaching with various accommodations (hiring a full-time teacher’s aid to keep an eye on the kiddos for safety reasons being the biggest), but I always knew I wouldn’t be able to teach the way I want to forever. I also feel like while I may not have mastered teaching, it no longer challenges me creatively like it once did.</p>
