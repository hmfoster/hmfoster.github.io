        <p>This week I learned how to use <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> to authenticate an AngularJS/Node.js app. Auth0 provides a fairly clear tutorial for the initial front- and back-end set-up, but a few of the later steps proved a bit trickier, in part because some of the information in the Auth0 documents for the Google API is a bit out of date. Here is a quick visual guide to supplement that provided by Auth0 once you&#39;ve finished the initial setup.</p>

        <p>This is the third part in a short series on applying test driven development to a JavaScript program using <a href="www.mochajs.org">Mocha</a>, <a href="www.chaijs.org">Chai</a>, and <a href="www.sinonjs.org">Sinon</a>. <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/Test-Driven-Development/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/TDD-2/">Part 2</a> gave a general overview of TDD and a brief walk-through of how to set up a testing environment. Part 3 will give a step-by-step example of the TDD process. I strongly recommend following along with your own code if you have yet to implement TDD at on your own, so if you have not set up your environment using the process described in Part 2, I suggest doing so before reading this post.</p>

        <p><a href="http://haileyfoster.com/Test-Driven-Development/">Part 1</a> of this short series on test driven development gave a brief overview or what TDD is, explained why you would use it, and introduced a few tools with which you can implement it. Part 2 will provide you with a step-by-step guide for how to set up a basic TDD environment using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> and <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a>. We will actually implement this environment in <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/TDD-3">Part 3</a>, and finally, Part 4 will provide additional details about when, why, and how to use <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a> to test more complex programs.</p>

        <p>Programming and teaching have a lot in common. In some ways, teaching students how to balance chemical equations is a lot like teaching a computer to do so: you have to have a clearly defined goal, create a basic plan, differentiate to account for differing strengths and weaknesses (<em>cough</em> Internet Explorer <em>cough</em>), determine if you were succesful, and modify your plans if you weren&#39;t. </p>

        <p>I think everyone can agree that fully understanding JavaScript&#39;s keyword <code>this</code> is...challenging. The object to which it refers changes depending upon the context in which it is called. Fortunately, you can use JavaScript&#39;s native <code>bind</code> method to take control of matters. The code below demonstrates both the <em>need</em> for the <code>bind</code> method and works up to explain how exactly it work. </p>

        <p>Sometimes it seems like Javascript has about a hundred different options for doing just about anything. While this flexibility can be powerful, it can also lead to confusion as it is sometimes unclear that several different constructs all essentially do the same thing. For example, Javascript has a variety of 
<span style = "cursos:help;" title = "a technique for encapsulating and modularizing object creation">instantiation patterns</span>, which can also be considered strategies for creating new classes:</p>

        <p>Alright Freetime, it was fun, but we officially have to have to say our goodbyes for now. I had a great time with you over the last two weeks; we had some epic walks through Portland, ate a few fantastic meals, caught up with friends, and just lolly-gagged in general. However, I started Hack Reactor a few days ago, and it&#39;s really time to let go.</p>

Today was my last &quot;normal&quot; teaching day; finals start tomorrow, and next Thursday is the last day of school. </p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was working on two pieces of Javascript code that would apply a test to each item in array. The function <code>every</code> would return <code>true</code> if all items in the collection passed the test, while the function <code>some</code> would return true if one or more of the items passed the test. Writing <code>every</code> was fairly straightforward using Javascript&#39;s <code>reduce</code> function, but because I was trying to use my <code>every</code> function in the <code>some</code> function to practice functional programming, it took me a while longer to write <code>some</code>. Worse yet, because both functions deal with many boolean values, they are a bit difficult to discuss. The first time I tried to explain my final version of the <code>some</code> function to one of my students, it just ended up sounding like gibberish; it sounded something like, &quot;...so if every value is not false, not every returns true, so some is true.&quot; Fortunately the students with whom I was talking is quite bright, so once I showed her how the function worked with an example. </p>
