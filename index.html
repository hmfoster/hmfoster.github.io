        <p>This is the third part in a short series on applying test driven development to a JavaScript program using <a href="www.mochajs.org">Mocha</a>, <a href="www.chaijs.org">Chai</a>, and <a href="www.sinonjs.org">Sinon</a>. <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/Test-Driven-Development/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/TDD-2/">Part 2</a> gave a general overview of TDD and a brief walk-through of how to set up a testing environment. Part 3 will give a step-by-step example of the TDD process. I strongly recommend following along with your own code if you have yet to implement TDD at on your own, so if you have not set up your environment using the process described in Part 2, I suggest doing so before reading this post.</p>

        <p><a href="http://haileyfoster.com/Test-Driven-Development/">Part 1</a> of this short series on test driven development gave a brief overview or what TDD is, explained why you would use it, and introduced a few tools with which you can implement it. Part 2 will provide you with a step-by-step guide for how to set up a basic TDD environment using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> and <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a>. We will actually implement this environment in <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/TDD-3">Part 3</a>, and finally, Part 4 will provide additional details about when, why, and how to use <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a> to test more complex programs.</p>

        <p>Programming and teaching have a lot in common. In some ways, teaching students how to balance chemical equations is a lot like teaching a computer to do so: you have to have a clearly defined goal, create a basic plan, differentiate to account for differing strengths and weaknesses (<em>cough</em> Internet Explorer <em>cough</em>), determine if you were succesful, and modify your plans if you weren&#39;t. </p>

        <p>I think everyone can agree that fully understanding JavaScript&#39;s keyword <code>this</code> is...challenging. The object to which it refers changes depending upon the context in which it is called. Fortunately, you can use JavaScript&#39;s native <code>bind</code> method to take control of matters. The code below demonstrates both the <em>need</em> for the <code>bind</code> method and works up to explain how exactly it work. </p>

        <p>Sometimes it seems like Javascript has about a hundred different options for doing just about anything. While this flexibility can be powerful, it can also lead to confusion as it is sometimes unclear that several different constructs all essentially do the same thing. For example, Javascript has a variety of 
<span style = "cursos:help;" title = "a technique for encapsulating and modularizing object creation">instantiation patterns</span>, which can also be considered strategies for creating new classes:</p>

        <p>Alright Freetime, it was fun, but we officially have to have to say our goodbyes for now. I had a great time with you over the last two weeks; we had some epic walks through Portland, ate a few fantastic meals, caught up with friends, and just lolly-gagged in general. However, I started Hack Reactor a few days ago, and it&#39;s really time to let go.</p>

        <p>I am so glad I decided to power through as much of the precourse work for Hack Reactor as possible when I first got it, because the last couple of weeks have been so packed with other things that I&#39;ve barely had a chance to glance back at any of it. Today was my last &quot;normal&quot; teaching day; finals start tomorrow, and next Thursday is the last day of school. </p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was working on two pieces of Javascript code that would apply a test to each item in array. The function <code>every</code> would return <code>true</code> if all items in the collection passed the test, while the function <code>some</code> would return true if one or more of the items passed the test. Writing <code>every</code> was fairly straightforward using Javascript&#39;s <code>reduce</code> function, but because I was trying to use my <code>every</code> function in the <code>some</code> function to practice functional programming, it took me a while longer to write <code>some</code>. Worse yet, because both functions deal with many boolean values, they are a bit difficult to discuss. The first time I tried to explain my final version of the <code>some</code> function to one of my students, it just ended up sounding like gibberish; it sounded something like, &quot;...so if every value is not false, not every returns true, so some is true.&quot; Fortunately the students with whom I was talking is quite bright, so once I showed her how the function worked with an example. </p>

Hack Reactor&#39;s precourse work touches upon many different subjects, so in just a few days, I&#39;ve worked through a ton of material! I&#39;ll try not to make that mistake again; I think it will be best if I try to write every other day.</p>

        <p>Over the last week or so, I&#39;ve been moving at a fairly rapid pace through Hack Reactor&#39;s precourse material. What I&#39;m finding though, is that I&#39;m spending a far greater amount of time learning related technologies and terminology (seem my last post) than I am actually solving the problems and reading through the material. I found this quite frustrating at first, but I&#39;ve come to realize that this indirect learning is becoming more an more valuable. For one thing, its allowing me to accelerate my learning via transfer and adaptation. </p>

        <p>Late last week I finally got into some completely novel concepts for me in the precourse work. The remaining Git ideas were fairly basic, but did describe the workflow HR expects us to follow). Not much interesting there. However, I then moved on to the section on Automated Testing, about which I had only had a vague understanding of the general idea before.</p>

        <p>Since getting the HR precourse work on Monday, I’m happy to say I’ve been able to work through the first section fairly quickly. It involved a basic review of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I had actually already read all of the provided resources. Because I want to make sure I REALLY know this stuff, I still worked back through it all, recording particularly important/tricky points with Evernote to review yet again before my start date in late June. I believe I now have a strong understanding of all of the concepts I reviewed, but of course I will need to do a lot more practice–especially with CSS positioning!–before I really feel competent.</p>

Before seeing the outline of the work, I was concerned that there would be many topics with which I have no familiarity. It looks like I’ve done a decent job prepping myself, however, as I have at least touched upon almost everything on the list.</p>

        <p>A couple of years ago, I decided to try writing a <a href="http://samjshah.com/2014/07/25/musings-on-the-180-blog/">180blog</a>. It didn’t workout so well. I started out strong two years in a row, and two weeks in just ran out of steam. You know the deal, conflicting priorities blah blah blah. Anyway, I’m now moving away from teaching anyway. Long story short, I love teaching, but it’s become impractical for me to continue. Not the usual teacher burnout; seven years in I’ve got my routines and plans down and have an excellent work-life balance. However, when I was fourteen I found out that I have a degenerative retinal disease called retinitis pigmentosa. Big words that basically mean I’m losing my vision from the outside in. Yes, I could technically continue teaching with various accommodations (hiring a full-time teacher’s aid to keep an eye on the kiddos for safety reasons being the biggest), but I always knew I wouldn’t be able to teach the way I want to forever. I also feel like while I may not have mastered teaching, it no longer challenges me creatively like it once did.</p>
