        <p>Last week I compared a few different JavaScript neural network libraries my team was considering to create an automated grocery list generator. We settled on <a href="https://github.com/cazala/synaptic">Synaptic.js</a> for its combined power and ease of use. Here, I will briefly describe how to get started with Synaptic to create your own neural networks.</p>

        <p>This week my team and I started in on a project to build a semi-automated grocery list app. I won’t be going into the details of everything the project entails, but one of the things we wanted it to do was to predict whether or not an item should be added to a user’s shopping list. Right away, we thought about using a neural network to add this functionality…the only problem was that none of us had used a neural network before.</p>

        <p>This week I learned how to use <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> to authenticate an AngularJS/Node.js app. Auth0 provides a fairly clear tutorial for the initial front- and back-end set-up, but a few of the later steps proved a bit trickier, in part because some of the information in the Auth0 documents for the Google API is a bit out of date. Here is a quick visual guide to supplement that provided by Auth0 once you’ve finished the initial setup.</p>

        <p>This is the third part in a short series on applying test driven development to a JavaScript program using <a href="www.mochajs.org">Mocha</a>, <a href="www.chaijs.org">Chai</a>, and <a href="www.sinonjs.org">Sinon</a>. <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/Test-Driven-Development/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/TDD-2/">Part 2</a> gave a general overview of TDD and a brief walk-through of how to set up a testing environment. Part 3 will give a step-by-step example of the TDD process. I strongly recommend following along with your own code if you have yet to implement TDD at on your own, so if you have not set up your environment using the process described in Part 2, I suggest doing so before reading this post.</p>

Part 2 will provide you with a step-by-step guide for how to set up a basic TDD environment using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> and <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a>. We will actually implement this environment in <a href="http://haileyfoster.com/TDD-3">Part 3</a>, and finally, Part 4 will provide additional details about when, why, and how to use <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a> to test more complex programs.</p>

        <p>Programming and teaching have a lot in common. In some ways, teaching students how to balance chemical equations is a lot like teaching a computer to do so: you have to have a clearly defined goal, create a basic plan, differentiate to account for differing strengths and weaknesses (<em>cough</em> Internet Explorer <em>cough</em>), determine if you were succesful, and modify your plans if you weren’t.</p>

        <p>I think everyone can agree that fully understanding JavaScript’s keyword <code>this</code> is…challenging. The object to which it refers changes depending upon the context in which it is called. Fortunately, you can use JavaScript’s native <code>bind</code> method to take control of matters. The code below demonstrates both the <em>need</em> for the <code>bind</code> method and works up to explain how exactly it work.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it seems like Javascript has about a hundred different options for doing just about anything. While this flexibility can be powerful, it can also lead to confusion as it is sometimes unclear that several different constructs all essentially do the same thing. For example, Javascript has a variety of 
<span style="cursos:help;" title="a technique for encapsulating and modularizing object creation">instantiation patterns</span>, which can also be considered strategies for creating new classes:</p>

        <p>Alright Freetime, it was fun, but we officially have to have to say our goodbyes for now. I had a great time with you over the last two weeks; we had some epic walks through Portland, ate a few fantastic meals, caught up with friends, and just lolly-gagged in general. However, I started Hack Reactor a few days ago, and it’s really time to let go.</p>
