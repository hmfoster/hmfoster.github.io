    <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was working on two pieces of Javascript code that would apply a test to each item in array. The function <code>every</code> would return <code>true</code> if all items in the collection passed the test, while the function <code>some</code> would return true if one or more of the items passed the test. Writing <code>every</code> was fairly straightforward using Javascript&#39;s <code>reduce</code> function, but because I was trying to use my <code>every</code> function in the <code>some</code> function to practice functional programming, it took me a while longer to write <code>some</code>. Worse yet, because both functions deal with many boolean values, they are a bit difficult to discuss. The first time I tried to explain my final version of the <code>some</code> function to one of my students, it just ended up sounding like gibberish; it sounded something like, &quot;...so if every value is not false, not every returns true, so some is true.&quot; Fortunately the students with whom I was talking is quite bright, so once I showed her how the function worked with an example. </p>

<p>Since I did such a paltry job the first time I tried to explain <code>some</code>, I&#39;ve decided to try again here. As all teachers know, if you can&#39;t teach it, you don&#39;t really understand it. So, instead of simply providing my solution, here I&#39;m going to try to explain it using pseudocode. </p>

<hr>

<h4>What the code <em>should</em> do:</h4>

<p><code>every(collection, test)</code>: Uses javascript&#39;s <code>reduce</code> function to apply a test to each item, and  returns true if all items in the collection pass the test. </p>

<p><code>some(collection, test)</code>: Uses <code>every</code> returns true if at least one item passes the test.</p>

<h4>The Logic:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>every</code> to determine if all of the items <strong>fail</strong> the test passed into <code>some</code>. 
This means that this <code>every</code> needs to test for the <strong>opposite</strong> of the <code>some</code> test.

<ul>
<li>If this <code>every</code> returns <code>true</code>, <strong>none</strong> of the items passed the test given to <code>some</code>, so <code>some</code> should return <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>If this <code>every</code> returns false, <strong>at least one</strong> item passed the test given to <code>some</code>, so <code>some</code> should return <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">var collection1 = {6, 4, 12, 10};
var collection2 = {6, 3, 12, 10};

//Return true if the item is odd.
var isOdd = function(item){
    return item % 2 == 1;
}
some(collection1, isOdd);
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
<li><code>some</code> passes <code>collection1</code> and <code>isOdd</code> to <code>every</code>. </li>
<li><code>every</code> tests to see if <strong>all</strong> of the items are not odd (<code>!isOdd</code>).</li>
<li>All of the items in <code>collection1</code> are not odd, so <code>every</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>When <code>every</code> returns <code>true</code>, <code>some</code> returns <code>false</code>: <em>none</em> of the items in <code>collection1</code> are odd.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>some(collection2, isOdd);</code></p>

<ol>
<li><code>some</code> passes <code>collection2</code> and <code>isOdd</code> to <code>every</code>.</li>
<li><code>every</code> tests to see if <strong>all</strong> of the items are not odd (<code>!isOdd</code>).</li>
<li>Because <code>collection2[1]</code> <strong>is</strong> odd, <code>every</code> returns <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Therefore, at least one item passes the <code>isOdd</code> test, so <code>some</code> returns <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Whew! Let me know if this does (or doesn&#39;t!) make sense, and if you have any suggestions for how to improve it!</p>
