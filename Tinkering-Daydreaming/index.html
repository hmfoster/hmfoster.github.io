    <p>Over the last week or so, I&#39;ve been moving at a fairly rapid pace through Hack Reactor&#39;s precourse material. What I&#39;m finding though, is that I&#39;m spending a far greater amount of time learning related technologies and terminology (seem my last post) than I am actually solving the problems and reading through the material. I found this quite frustrating at first, but I&#39;ve come to realize that this indirect learning is becoming more an more valuable. For one thing, its allowing me to accelerate my learning via transfer and adaptation. </p>

<p>I have also found that while all of the reading, tutorials, etc... I did before beginning the precourse work is a helpful foundation, actually USING all of these tools is allowing me learn much more efficiently. This should come as no surprise, given that Bloom&#39;s Hierarchy yadda yadda. As a result, I&#39;ve decided to try to apply what I&#39;m learning as much as possible outside of the precourse work. For example, I&#39;ve switched from hosting my blog on WordPress.com, to using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosting through GitHub. This will force me to practice using the command line, writing HTML, CSS and Markdown, and using Git. </p>

<p>Now, all of that being said, I have still been spending quite a bit of time on the actual precourse work. I read through HR&#39;s presentation on closures and scoping rules and <em>thought</em> that I understood it pretty well. However, when I then moved on to the second part of rewriting the library, I found these concepts to be quite a bit more difficult in practice. Fortunately, this forced me to actually <strong>use</strong> the Chrome Developer&#39;s tools. Even once I started using the debugger, I still got stuck on one of the functions for quite awhile. But then, on my walk home<sup>*</sup>...EPIPHANY! Once I stopped fussy over the code in my computer and just thought about it while daydreaming, I realized I just needed to include an object in my code. Der. </p>

<p>Got home, ate a snack, and popped open the laptop to put my theory to practice. And then IT STILL DIDN&#39;T WORK. Fortunately (or not!), I <em>can&#39;t</em> let a good puzzle go unsolved, so I chose to keep at it and just have leftovers for dinner. I&#39;m happy to say my perseverence paid off and I got the code working in time to watch one of my Wednesday night television. I originally thought I&#39;d give myself a break today as a reward...but here I am, already itching to move on to the next problem. I guess that&#39;s a good sign!</p>
